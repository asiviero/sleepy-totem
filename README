Plugin for Totem movie player that can shutdown or hibernate the computer when the playlist finishes.

To install in your home directory just run:
$ chmod u+x install.sh
$ ./install.sh

Start Totem and open the plugin dialog from the Edit->Plugins menu
Enable "Sleepy Totem"

A new menu "Sleep" should now be added to Totem. 



TODO

* Fix thread joining to allow stopping sleep mode and starting again (from either pre or post timeout dialog)
* Get some nice tickable gtk menus
* Move timeout to config box
* Write README
